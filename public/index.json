I am particularly interested in how cultural evolutionary theories persist in contemporary contexts and shape ritual practice as well as theory produced on it. I am currently developing a conceptual framework to better address the ongoing relational denigration of different peoples and practices by means of spatio-temporal othering, beginning in Morocco with the topic of animal sacrifice.\nI also conduct research on artificial intelligence, exploring the relational denigration of humans vis-à-vis AI, theorizing this as Sub-Alpha Humanism. This research draws attention to this under-explored ‘risk’ of AI, particularly relevant to post-human imaginaries and futures.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/author/tierra-mcmahon/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/tierra-mcmahon/","section":"authors","summary":"Hello and Welcome!
