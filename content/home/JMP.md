[The Distributional Costs of Net-Zero: A HANK Perspective.](files/job-market-paper.pdf)  

Poster [Here](files/poster.pdf)

This paper investigates the distributional impacts of implementing the net-zero emissions target in the U.S. for the 2050 horizon. With uncertainty over green technologies inhibiting the feasibility of low carbon pricing, the cost of environmental policy is expected to increase substantially in order to meet the net-zero emissions objective. Accordingly, the consumption equivalent cost of such fiscal policy could hinder the intended effects of the policy and create additional inefficiencies. First, we empirically show how carbon pricing shocks propagate in the economy, by using an IV-SVAR for the case of the California cap-and-trade market. Then, we show how bottom and top income households' consumption is asymmetrically impacted following carbon price shocks. Thereafter, we model a heterogeneous household economy and investigate how implementing a carbon price impacts consumption depending on different income and wealth levels. We also investigate the distributional impacts of gradually tightening fiscal policy consistent with the net-zero emissions target. In addition, we show how distributing revenue from the carbon policy could partially offset consumption losses. Finally, we extend our analysis to: i) the case of abatement learning and show how fiscal redistribution and green innovation decreases carbon prices and boosts consumption over the transition, and ii) the case of sticky prices and show how carbon pricing induces lower inflation over the transition period, while inflationary pressure manifests over the long-run, suggesting an active role of monetary policy.
