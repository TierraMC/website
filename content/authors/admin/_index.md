Thank you for visiting this space. Please note it is currently under (re)construction and will be updated shortly in content and form. 

I am an Assistant Professor of (Socio-Cultural) Anthropology at IE University in Spain. I have dedicated myself professionally to anthropology and also have previous training in Economics, International Relations, and Philosophy across four continents. Previously, I worked as an Economist and Policy Analyst at the OECD in Paris and served at UNESCO under the aegis of the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals Agenda. These professional experiences and my educational trajectory have greatly impacted my understanding of key features of knowledge production and world-making on a global scale, which she seeks to bring to my anthropological research and teaching.

My current research examines the (enduring) political economy of modernity in urban Morocco with attention to how modernity narratives (and other teleological spinoffs) are employed to justify or change social practices. I am particularly interested in how cultural evolutionary theories persist in contemporary contexts and shape ritual practice as well as theory produced on it. I am currently developing a conceptual framework to better address the ongoing relational denigration of different peoples and practices by means of spatio-temporal othering, beginning in Morocco with the topic of animal sacrifice.

I also conduct research on artificial intelligence, exploring the relational denigration of humans vis-à-vis AI, theorizing this as Sub-Alpha Humanism. This research draws attention to this under-explored ‘risk’ of AI, particularly relevant to post-human imaginaries and futures.
